                ⚡ Contributed to the team-wide Node 22 upgrade across all services - great collaborative effort from the whole engineering team to keep our infrastructure modern and secure.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🚀 Worked on a new welcome banner to improve first-time user experience.

              <p class="update-content">
                🗑️ Continued infrastructure cleanup: removed deprecated SendGrid integration, and old crons and workers - making the codebase leaner and easier to maintain.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                💬 Had some great conversations with teammates to define scope for our next project - exciting things ahead!

              <p class="update-content">
                🐛 Squashed a few bugs: prevented duplicate native posts from showing empty content, and posts getting stuck in "Sending" - no more confused users wondering why their posts won't show or publish.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                Some weeks are about flashy new features. This one was about making Buffer more reliable and removing tech debt that's been hanging around. The kind of work that users don't see directly, but definitely feel when things just work.

                This week was packed with meaningful progress building for a new experiment, continue with infrastructure cleanup, and celebrating the launch of Buffer's AI Assistant. So proud of what the team built 👏
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🧪 Prepared a new experiment launching Monday: Built new upgrade modal and repositioned CTAs across one area of the product. Excited to see how new users respond to this next week.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ✨ Small wins that matter: Fixed a bug in the collapsible sidebar, added a loading skeleton for the app menu.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                💭 Monthly reflections: Had my monthly check-in with my manager. These sessions always help me zoom out and see the bigger picture beyond the code.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🏗️ Infrastructure cleanup continues: After last week's refactor, we're slowly removing the unnecessary complexity from our stack. Less moving parts = easier maintenance.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔥 Caused a major incident: My SQS queue refactor took down password reset emails. One revert later, we're stable. Lesson learned: canary releases > big bang changes. The team's quick response was incredible.

              <p class="update-content">
                Despite it being a shorter week with Monday's bank holiday and juggling work while one of my kids was home sick 🤒, I'm grateful for the meaningful progress we made.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🏗️ Infrastructure modernization: Led a major cleanup effort removing legacy webworkers across our platform, reducing technical debt and simplifying our architecture for better maintainability.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔒 Security & code quality: Addressed the last bits of a security vulnerability in our dependencies, refined error handling, and removed redundant code paths—making our platform more secure, stable, and easier to maintain.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ✨ Smarter scheduling: Enhanced our Best Time to Post algorithm to avoiding conflicts with already scheduled content, giving users better recommendations.

              <p class="update-content">
                🚀 Collaborative QA: Worked with the team to thoroughly test a new feature that's launching next week—excited to see it in our users' hands!
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                Beyond code, I also spent time giving peer feedback to teammates: this is an important part of building a strong engineering culture at Buffer 🤗

                Every week I'll be sharing what I'm building at Buffer. The wins, the bugs, the security patches nobody sees. Real engineering work, unfiltered.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🌚 Dark Mode: Mission Accomplished 🎃 This week was all about the polish—fixed those pesky images and elements that weren't playing nice in dark mode, cleaned up some styling rough edges, and is finally here: Dark mode is officially "just mode" now.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🎨 Making Buffer prettier, one illustration at a time: Rolled out custom illustrations across login, empty states, and upgrade paths. Out with the generic stock art, in with designs that actually feel like Buffer. Bonus: they look great in both light AND dark mode.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                ⬆️⬇️ The Queue is getting smarter: Ever wanted to instantly move a post to the top or bottom of your queue? We're testing this internally right now! Added a reorder menu and can't wait to test this out more broadly.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                📟 This week I'm On-call 🚨: So between shipping features, I'm also troubleshooting a few production hiccups. It's all part of the job—you learn the system deeply when you're the one keeping it running.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                🔒 The not-so-glamorous (but important): Patched an Axios vulnerability. Added PostHog integration for Session Replays. We are going to be trialing this out.
              </p>
              <p class="update-content">
                Building in public means sharing the whole picture—the flashy features AND the security patches that nobody sees but everyone needs.
