            <p>
              In 2019, I sat across from my computer screen, reading the rejection email from Buffer. I had made it all the way to the final interview—further than I'd gotten with many companies—but it wasn't enough. The position went to someone else.
            </p>

            <p>
              It stung. Of course it did. Buffer wasn't just another company on my application list. Their transparent culture, remote-first approach, and commitment to work-life balance aligned perfectly with the kind of workplace I wanted to be part of. Getting so close only to fall short felt like a door slamming shut.
            </p>

            <p>
              But here's the thing about doors: sometimes they don't slam shut. Sometimes they just close for a while.
            </p>

            <h2>Staying in Orbit</h2>

            <p>
              After the rejection, I could have written Buffer off entirely. "They didn't want me" would have been an easy narrative to accept. Instead, I decided to stay connected. I followed their blog, read their transparency reports, watched as they experimented with a four-day work week. I kept learning, kept improving my skills, and kept Buffer in my peripheral vision.
            </p>

            <p>
              I wasn't stalking them or desperately waiting by the door. I was simply staying engaged with a company whose values resonated with me, while continuing to grow as an engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two years later, in 2021, I saw another opening. This time, I didn't hesitate. I applied again.
            </p>

            <p>
              And this time, I got the offer.
            </p>

            <h2>What Changed?</h2>

            <p>
              Looking back, I've realized that the 2019 rejection wasn't really about me being "not good enough." It was about timing, fit, and a hundred other variables I couldn't control. In those two years between applications, both Buffer and I had evolved. The company had grown, their needs had shifted, and I had gained new experiences and skills that made me a better fit for what they were looking for.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rejection wasn't a judgment on my worth—it was just information about that particular moment in time.
            </p>

            <h2>Lessons Worth Keeping</h2>

            <p>This experience taught me several things that have shaped how I approach my career:</p>

            <p>
              <strong>Rejection is rarely personal.</strong> Most hiring decisions come down to timing, team dynamics, budget constraints, or specific skill matches. A "no" says more about circumstances than it does about you.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Both sides of the table are moving targets.</strong> Companies change their priorities, restructure teams, and evolve their culture. You're also not the same candidate you were six months or two years ago. What didn't align before might align perfectly later.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Genuine interest looks different from desperation.</strong> Staying connected with a company you admire—following their content, understanding their journey, engaging with their mission—isn't desperate. It's authentic. And authenticity is something employers notice.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Every rejection is data.</strong> Whether you use it to improve your interview skills, refine your technical abilities, or simply better understand what you're looking for in a role, rejection offers valuable information if you're willing to learn from it.
            </p>

            <h2>A Note to Anyone Facing Rejection Today</h2>

            <p>
              If you're reading this while processing your own rejection letter, I want you to know that it doesn't define your worth or derail your goals. The companies that said no today might say yes tomorrow. Your skills, your value, and your potential aren't diminished by someone else's hiring decision.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometimes the best opportunities are worth the patience and persistence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your dream job might not be out of reach—it might just be a "not yet." Keep going. Keep learning. Keep staying true to what matters to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              The door might open when you least expect it.
